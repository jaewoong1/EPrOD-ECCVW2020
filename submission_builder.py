-----------------------------------

Helper code to make submissions to the challenge.

The test data consists of images grouped into sequences ('000000', '000001', etc..)
The submission format is a folder containing a json file for each sequence ('000000_.json', '__.json', etc..)
Each json file should contain the following structure:
```
{
  "classes": [<an ordered list of class names>],
  "detections": [
    [
      {
        "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
        "covars": [
          [[xx1, xy1],[xy1, yy1],
          [[xx2, xy2],[xy2, yy2]
        ],
        "label_probs": [<an ordered list of probabilities for each class>]
      },
      {
      }
    ],
    [],
    []
    ...
  ]
}
```
There must be an entry in the "detections" list for every image in the sequence, even if it is an empty list.
The "label_probs" list in each detection must match the "classes" list at the top level, such that the i-th entry
in "label_probs" is the probability of the i-th class in the class list.
"label_probs" should be a normalized probability distribution, summing to 1.
If it sums to more than 1, it will be normalized. If it sums to less than 1, it is assumed the remaining probability
is assigned to a background class, and will be ignored.
The scoring program will re-order and match classes based on their string names (see scoring_program).

The following functions and classes are designed to help create these json files in the correct format,
They are here to make submission easier, but are not required, feel free to modify or use some or all of this

## Abstract

Even small errors in object detection algorithms can lead to serious accidents in
critical fields such as factories and autonomous vehicles. Thus, a so-called probabilistic object
detector (PrOD) has been proposed. However, the PrOD still has problems of underestimating
the uncertainty of results and causing biased approximation due to limited information. To
solve the above-mentioned problems, this paper proposes a new PrOD composed of four key
techniques, i.e., albedo extraction, soft-DropBlock, stacked NMS, and inter-frame processing.
In terms of Probability-based Detection Quality (PDQ) metric, the proposed object detector
achieved 22.46, which is 4.46 higher than a backbone method, for the Australian Centre for
Robotic Vision (ACRV) validation dataset consisting of four videos.
